"""Block cycle orchestrator.

One cycle:
  1. drain queue          inbound txs and blocks from net_in_q
  2. sync, if triggered   only on evidence we're behind, or on silence
  3. vdf.evaluate()       ~120s, draining throughout, abandoned early once it
                          provably can't land in time (_should_abandon)
  4. assemble + spread    own candidate enters propagation (gossip.py)
  5. pick winner          lowest vdf_output among the candidates in hand
  6. commit               swap ChainState, persist, publish view

Nothing in the cycle waits, but a height still gets a real draw: after
adopting a block we start on the next height immediately and keep the
previous one open for a short window, during which a candidate with a
lower vdf_output still takes it (_reorg_to_sibling). The draw is what
decides a height by the evaluation each builder paid for rather than by
who reached us first; building on the next height throughout is what makes
giving it a window cost nothing.

The window runs from the first valid candidate anyone produced for that
height (open_draw), not from our own completion, so it is the same
interval on every node. Anchored to our own completion it would stretch
by however long we took, handing a slower node a longer window and
cancelling out the speed the chain is supposed to pay for. Finishing
outside it is losing the height, which is also the whole basis of
_should_abandon: work that cannot land inside the window cannot land at
all, so it is dropped in favour of the next height.

Flask threads read node.view (a NodeView snapshot). The node loop is the
sole writer; every mutation publishes a new snapshot atomically.

# Sync is event-driven, not scheduled. Two things can tell a node it is
# behind, and only two:
#
#   1. An inbound block at a height above our tip. This already reaches
#      every node for free, carried by propagation, and it names a peer
#      who has the chain. See _handle_inbound_block.
#   2. Silence. If no block arrives for meaningfully longer than the pace
#      the chain itself is running at, either the network stalled or we
#      are isolated, and no inbound block is ever going to tell us that.
#
# Polling on a fixed interval was a way of compensating for throwing (1)
# away. It scaled badly for what it bought: picking a peer at random, a
# node with k of N peers ahead needs ~N/k polls to stumble onto one, so
# detection got *slower* as the network grew, while the cost of each poll
# grew with chain length.
#
# The silence threshold is this multiple of the chain's own recent median
# block interval (block_mod.block_time_stats, measured, not assumed), so
# it tracks whatever pace the network is actually running at rather than
# a hardcoded seconds value. Above 1 so ordinary block-to-block jitter
# doesn't read as silence.
# A reorg that replaced this many blocks or more is worth remembering. One
# block below it is the draw settling a tie, which happens constantly and
# is not what anyone is looking for when they ask how deep reorgs go.

#
# Blocks only tell us what our own peers choose to forward. An eclipsed
# node, or one partitioned onto a consistent but inferior fork, sees a
# healthy stream and never goes silent, so no block-driven trigger ever
# fires. Random, because best-known is exactly who an eclipsing attacker
# would arrange for us to keep asking.
#
# Once per cycle because a probe is now one GETINFO datagram that ends on
# the work comparison. Frequency was never what made the old polling
# expensive. Every poll unconditionally ran an O(log chain) fork search
# and a fetch, and that is what had to go. At a datagram a cycle the cost
# is a rounding error against a ~120s evaluation, so there is no reason to
# detect an eclipse in twenty block times when one will do.

# How much of a fetch to do before handing the loop back. A sync of many
# blocks used to run to completion inline, which meant minutes during which
# the node drained nothing and forwarded nothing, and under a stem that is
# worse than slow for us, it is destructive for everybody: a hop handed to a
# node in that state dies there, and the sender only finds out by rework. So
# a pass takes a bounded bite and returns; we are still behind, the trigger
# fires again next time round, and propagation keeps flowing meanwhile.

# node's own measured gossip-echo round trips currently look like), on
# the reasoning that a sync pass holding the loop past that point costs
# the same as a stalled gossip echo would: anyone who stemmed an item to
# this node in the meantime gives up and re-floods, so time spent past
# that deadline is time spent being a hole in propagation rather than a
# correctness problem. That reasoning about the cost was fine; reusing
# the echo deadline's actual value for it was not. It measures a single
# lightweight confirmation round trip, and check_and_sync's own work is
# not that: Syncer._find_fork_point makes several sequential real round
# trips (a binary search, not one probe) before a single page is even
# requested, and syncer.py's own retry logic now correctly refuses to
# run past whatever's left of this budget (see Syncer._request_sync_with_retry),
# where it used to silently ignore it. Once that stopped being silent, a
# 2-10s budget failed most real fork searches outright under any real
# network latency, not just adversarial ones, exactly the kind of
# regression that looks like sync itself got slower.
#
# Sized instead for what the work here actually needs: room for several

# fetch under ordinary conditions, while staying a small fraction of a

        A block is invalid until MIN_BLOCK_SPACING_SECONDS have passed

        nothing valid to publish yet. What it used to do was publish
        anyway: stamp the clock, fail its own validation, and throw away
        the evaluation it had just spent two minutes on. Clamping the
        stamp forward only moved the problem, since the next block's floor

        it breaks the future-timestamp rule a block or two later.

        earliest moment a peer would tolerate a future stamp. Timestamps
        stay equal to when the block was actually made, the chain's
        timeline keeps tracking reality, and nothing accumulates.

        Measuring against a whole block interval instead, as this did

        draw it could have entered, and would start the next height a
        minute late, every height, forever. Nothing it computed could ever
        be used. Abandoning immediately costs it nothing it could have kept
        and puts it back on the clock for the next height.

        Erring either way is survivable, which is why a rough estimate is
