"""Node-local settings: operator policy, never protocol.

Nothing here is consensus. Every value is a choice one operator makes for
their own node, and no other node can tell or care what it is set to.

Resolution order, highest first:
  1. environment variable
  2. value stored in this node's database
  3. shipped default

The environment comes first so a node can be run with a setting forced for
one launch (a container, a systemd unit, a one-off) without that quietly
rewriting what the operator saved. When a value is forced that way the
settings page shows it as such rather than pretending it can be edited.

# How long a height keeps accepting a better same-height block. See
# Node._reorg_to_sibling for what the draw is and Node.open_draw for what
# the window is anchored to.
#
# What this number really sets is the draw's tie tolerance: a builder who
# finishes within it of the first finisher gets compared on vdf_output,
# and one who finishes outside it loses the height outright however good
# its output would have been. So it is the line between "these two tied"
# and "that one was simply slower", expressed in seconds.
#
# It has a floor, and the floor is propagation, not taste. A block has to
# reach other nodes before their windows close, so a window shorter than
# the time a block takes to get around is one where even a genuinely
# simultaneous builder loses for being far away in the graph. That is the
# draw degrading back into deciding heights by network position, which is
# the one thing it exists to prevent, and it degrades silently: nothing
# errors, the draws just quietly stop being fair. Propagation here is not
# raw link latency either, since a block walks a stem of ~10 expected
# hops (gossip.STEM_CONTINUE_PROB) before it floods at all.
#
# The ceiling is not free either, and it is the side that is easy to get
# wrong. Every second above propagation is a second of real speed
# advantage converted into a coin flip: a builder ten seconds faster than
# the field wins outright under a five-second window and ties under a
# fifteen-second one, having done nothing differently. Measured
# propagation is around half a second for an ordinary block, so a setting
# in the low seconds already clears the floor several times over, and the
# rest is a choice about how much of a lead should count.
#
# This node does not widen it from measurement, and deliberately so after
# trying. What was measured was the gap between a height's first candidate
# and each later one, which is not propagation but how far apart the
# builders are in speed, so the window grew to cover exactly the
# differences the draw exists to settle and erased the lead it was meant
# to adjudicate. One number, set here.
#
# Worth knowing that unlike most settings here, this one is not purely
# local in effect: nodes running very different windows admit different
# sets of entrants to the same draw, and disagree more often as a result.

# hands as a matter of routine (Node._reorg_to_sibling) and the node only
# bothers recording a reorg at all once it replaced two blocks or more
# (node.REORG_NOTABLE_DEPTH), because one is ordinary traffic. A payment
# accepted at depth one can therefore be un-accepted by the chain working
# exactly as designed, and in a swap that means reciprocating a payment
# that no longer exists.
#
# Raising it costs time and nothing else: each step waits for this many
# blocks, so the whole trade lengthens roughly in proportion. Worth doing
# for a large trade, pointless for a small one, which is why it is a

# There used to be a per-node setting here, the most this node would
# have outstanding in one step with a stranger. It was never really node-
# local policy the way it claimed to be, despite living in this file
# ("operator policy, never protocol", see the module docstring): it fed
# straight into the exposure cap a maker computed when accepting a fill,
# which is a number the maker signs into the FillResponse and the other
# side (and any bystander reconstructing the trade later, see
# trust._network_tally_by_counterparty) has to be able to recompute
# identically to check it. A value either side could privately tune made
# that impossible to verify and turned trade sizing into something a
# maker unilaterally decided rather than a fact both parties' own public
# trust history determines - exactly the asymmetry swap.plan_mutual and
# swap_engine._open_taker_trade's own cap check now close. What used to
# be this setting is swap.DEFAULT_STRANGER_CAP_STROOPS: one fixed number
# every node computes a trade's terms from, not an operator dial.

# The trust score (trust.get_detail's "score") a counterparty must have
# with this node before a fill request against your own order auto-
# accepts. Below it, the request is not declined, it sits on the Market
# page waiting for a person to accept or decline it by hand.
#
# There used to be a second switch here, a plain on/off for auto-accept
# itself. It was redundant with this one: a trust score can never go
# negative, so a floor of zero already means "accept anyone" and is the
# whole of what the switch's "on" position did. Its "off" position (never
# auto-accept, review everything by hand) has no finite score below it,
# but this setting still expresses it directly: enter inf and no
# counterparty, however trusted, will ever clear it, so every request
# waits for a person on the Market page. One number now covers the
# entire range from "trust nobody automatically" to "trust everybody
# automatically" that used to need two settings to say.
#
# Zero, the default, auto-accepts anyone, including a total stranger
# (score 0): the exposure cap already bounds what a stranger can cost
# you in one step, so nothing unsafe changes by leaving this at zero.
# Raising it keeps automatic trading within counterparties who have
# already earned some standing while everyone else waits for a person;
# inf is the limit of that, everyone waits for a person.
