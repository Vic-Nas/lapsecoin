"""Node-local settings: operator policy, never protocol.

Nothing here is consensus. Every value is a choice one operator makes for
their own node, and no other node can tell or care what it is set to.

Resolution order, highest first:
  1. environment variable
  2. value stored in this node's database
  3. shipped default

The environment comes first so a node can be run with a setting forced for
one launch (a container, a systemd unit, a one-off) without that quietly
rewriting what the operator saved. When a value is forced that way the
settings page shows it as such rather than pretending it can be edited.

# How long a height keeps accepting a better same-height block. See
# Node._reorg_to_sibling for what the draw is and Node.open_draw for what
# the window is anchored to.
#
# What this number really sets is the draw's tie tolerance: a builder who
# finishes within it of the first finisher gets compared on vdf_output,
# and one who finishes outside it loses the height outright however good
# its output would have been. So it is the line between "these two tied"
# and "that one was simply slower", expressed in seconds.
#
# It has a floor, and the floor is propagation, not taste. A block has to
# reach other nodes before their windows close, so a window shorter than
# the time a block takes to get around is one where even a genuinely
# simultaneous builder loses for being far away in the graph. That is the
# draw degrading back into deciding heights by network position, which is
# the one thing it exists to prevent, and it degrades silently: nothing
# errors, the draws just quietly stop being fair. Propagation here is not
# raw link latency either, since a block walks a stem of ~10 expected
# hops (gossip.STEM_CONTINUE_PROB) before it floods at all.
#
# The ceiling is not free either, and it is the side that is easy to get
# wrong. Every second above propagation is a second of real speed
# advantage converted into a coin flip: a builder ten seconds faster than
# the field wins outright under a five-second window and ties under a
# fifteen-second one, having done nothing differently. Measured
# propagation is around half a second for an ordinary block, so a setting
# in the low seconds already clears the floor several times over, and the
# rest is a choice about how much of a lead should count.
#
# This node does not widen it from measurement, and deliberately so after
# trying. What was measured was the gap between a height's first candidate
# and each later one, which is not propagation but how far apart the
# builders are in speed, so the window grew to cover exactly the
# differences the draw exists to settle and erased the lead it was meant
# to adjudicate. One number, set here.
#
# Worth knowing that unlike most settings here, this one is not purely
# local in effect: nodes running very different windows admit different
# sets of entrants to the same draw, and disagree more often as a result.
