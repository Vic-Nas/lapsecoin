"""Propagation: one Dandelion stem/fluff mechanism for both blocks and txs.

Why one mechanism
-----------------
Blocks and txs are the same problem: get an item to every node without
advertising that this node is where it came from. They used to propagate
two different ways -- blocks epidemically at the transport layer (msg_id
dedup, sender excluded, no stem at all, and relayed *before* anyone
validated them), txs at this layer (hash dedup, no sender exclusion, stem
with a peer-count cliff). Two mechanisms meant two sets of bugs and two
places to reason about scale, for one problem.

Both now go through spread()/relay() below.

Dedup is by item hash, not msg_id
---------------------------------
The hash is what identifies the item; a msg_id is per-send, so re-sending
the same item mints a new one and sails straight through a msg_id-based
dedup, starting a fresh flood wave at every node that sees it. Hash dedup
is idempotent no matter how many times an item is re-originated, which is
what makes the rework path below safe.

Stem rule, one rule at every scale
----------------------------------
At each hop: fluff with probability 1-STEM_CONTINUE_PROB; otherwise
forward to a single peer that is not the one who just sent it to us; and
if there is no such peer, fluff.

That last clause is what replaces the old MIN_PEERS_FOR_STEM cliff, and
it is deliberately not a special case: it is the same condition evaluated
everywhere, it just fires more often on a sparse graph. Note it is a
*preference* against the predecessor, never a hard exclusion -- a node
with one peer cannot assume that peer has any onward link, so refusing to
use it would strand the item rather than protect it. Fluffing early costs
a little anonymity; dead-ending loses the item.

Stem length is therefore emergent from the topology and the coin flip,
not a configured hop count: on a 2-peer node the walk fluffs almost
immediately by itself, on a well-connected one it keeps going.

Rework
------
The originator holds an item it started and watches for its own flood to
come back (see Node). No echo means the walk died somewhere -- a dropped
datagram, a peer that went away mid-walk -- so it is re-sent. That only
happens on failure, so its cost is proportional to the failure rate, not
to traffic.
