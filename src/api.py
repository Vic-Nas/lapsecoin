"""HTTP API and browser UI for LapseCoin nodes.

Peer communication is handled separately over UDP. This module only serves
human-facing browser UI and a JSON API for wallets and block explorers.

Two Flask apps are created by the factory functions at the bottom of this file:

Public app  (default port 8333, externally reachable):
  UI:
    GET  /                            dashboard
    GET  /explorer                    recent block list
    GET  /explorer/block/<height>     block detail
    GET  /explorer/tx/<hash>          transaction detail
    GET  /address?addr=<addr>         address balance and history
    GET  /address/distribution/<n>    addresses in wealth-distribution bucket n
    GET  /whitepaper                  protocol whitepaper
    GET  /peers                       connected peer list
    GET  /send                        403 (local interface only)

  JSON API (Content-Type: application/json):
    GET  /api/info
         {"height", "tip_hash", "genesis_hash", "mempool_size",
          "address", "peer_count", "total_minted", "can_mint",
          "block_reward", "block_time_ratio", "status"}

    GET  /api/block/<height>          full block object or {"error": "not found"}
    GET  /api/tx/<hash>               transaction object (confirmed or mempool),
                                       plus "confirmations": 0 while unconfirmed,
                                       else current height minus the tx's block
                                       height, plus 1

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/balance
         {"address", "balance_ticks", "balance_lapse"}

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/history
         [{"height", "tx_hash", "direction": "sent"|"received", "tx"}, ...]

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/valid
         {"address", "valid": true|false}

    GET  /api/mempool
         {"size": <n>, "transactions": [{"hash", "from", "outputs", "fee"}, ...]}

    POST /api/tx/send                 rate-limited: 20 requests/second
         Request body (JSON): a signed plaintext tx dict, see tx.py
         (tx_mod.create): {"from", "pubkey", "outputs", "nonce", "fee",
         "signature"}
         Response:
           {"ok": true,  "tx_hash": <hex>}
           {"ok": false, "error": <string>}

Private app  (default port 8335 or public port +2, 127.0.0.1 only):
  All public UI and JSON API endpoints, plus:
    GET/POST /send                    build and sign a send transaction
    POST     /api/peers/add           {"host": <str>, "port": <int>}

Exchange / third-party integration:
  There is no dedicated integration API; the JSON API above is enough to
  build one, following the same shape most exchanges already expect from a
  Bitcoin-Core-style node (getbalance, listtransactions, gettransaction,
  validateaddress, sendtoaddress):
    - deposit detection: poll /api/address/<addr>/history for new entries
    - confirmation depth: the "confirmations" field on /api/tx/<hash>
    - address format check: /api/address/<addr>/valid
    - withdrawal: build and sign a tx exactly like tx.py's create() does,
      then POST it to /api/tx/send. Signing is never done over the network;
      an integrator holds and signs with their own keys, the same as any
      Bitcoin-style wallet integration would.

  One real structural difference from Bitcoin: a LapseCoin node has a
  single wallet address, not per-customer address generation (no
  getnewaddress equivalent). An integrator wanting one deposit address per
  customer needs to run one node per customer, or track customers by a
  memo/tag against a single shared address, the same way exchanges already
  handle XRP- or Monero-style account-index coins.

    Both apps run on Werkzeug's threaded server, which handles every

    of its own. Nothing closes it when the thread exits, so each request
    that touches storage leaves an open sqlite handle behind (two, with
    WAL) until the garbage collector happens to get to it. A polled
    endpoint opens them faster than that, and the process dies on EMFILE
    with hundreds of handles to the same database file.

    Registered per app rather than inside a route, so it also covers any
    route added later that touches storage, and covers the ones that do so
    indirectly: reading a setting is a database read, which is easy to
    forget when it looks like a plain attribute (Node.advertised_addr).
