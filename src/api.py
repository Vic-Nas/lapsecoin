"""HTTP API and browser UI for LapseCoin nodes.

Peer communication is handled separately over UDP. This module only serves
human-facing browser UI and a JSON API for wallets and block explorers.

Two Flask apps are created by the factory functions at the bottom of this file:

Public app  (default port 8333, externally reachable):
  UI:
    GET  /                            dashboard
    GET  /explorer                    recent block list
    GET  /explorer/block/<height>     block detail
    GET  /explorer/tx/<hash>          transaction detail
    GET  /address?addr=<addr>         address balance and history
    GET  /address/distribution/<n>    addresses in wealth-distribution bucket n
    GET  /whitepaper                  protocol whitepaper
    GET  /network                     connected peer list
    GET  /board                       public board (tagged-memo transactions)
    GET  /send                        403 (local interface only)

  JSON API (Content-Type: application/json):
    GET  /api/info
         {"height", "tip_hash", "genesis_hash", "mempool_size",
          "address", "peer_count", "total_minted", "can_mint",
          "block_reward", "block_time_ratio", "status"}

    GET  /api/block/<height>          full block object or {"error": "not found"}
    GET  /api/tx/<hash>               transaction object (confirmed or mempool),
                                       plus "confirmations": 0 while unconfirmed,
                                       else current height minus the tx's block
                                       height, plus 1

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/balance
         {"address", "balance_ticks", "balance_lapse"}

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/history[?limit=<n>&offset=<n>]
         [{"height", "tx_hash", "direction": "sent"|"received", "tx"}, ...]
         Newest first. Returns everything when limit is omitted, which is
         what it has always done; limit/offset select a slice. The full
         count is in the X-Total-Count response header either way, so a
         caller can page without first fetching everything to find out
         how much there is.

    GET  /api/address/<addr>/valid
         {"address", "valid": true|false}

    GET  /api/mempool
         {"size": <n>, "transactions": [{"hash", "from", "outputs", "fee"}, ...]}

    POST /api/tx/send                 rate-limited: 20 requests/second
         Request body (JSON): a signed plaintext tx dict, see tx.py
         (tx_mod.create): {"from", "pubkey", "outputs", "nonce", "fee",
         "signature", "memo"?}
         memo is optional, plaintext, at most tx.MAX_MEMO_BYTES bytes;
         omit the key entirely rather than sending an empty string
         Response:
           {"ok": true,  "tx_hash": <hex>}
           {"ok": false, "error": <string>}

Private app  (default port 8335 or public port +2, 127.0.0.1 only):
  All public UI and JSON API endpoints, plus:
    GET/POST /send                    build and sign a send transaction
    POST     /api/peers/add           {"host": <str>, "port": <int>}

Exchange / third-party integration:
  There is no dedicated integration API; the JSON API above is enough to
  build one, following the same shape most exchanges already expect from a
  Bitcoin-Core-style node (getbalance, listtransactions, gettransaction,
  validateaddress, sendtoaddress):
    - deposit detection: poll /api/address/<addr>/history for new entries
    - confirmation depth: the "confirmations" field on /api/tx/<hash>
    - address format check: /api/address/<addr>/valid
    - withdrawal: build and sign a tx exactly like tx.py's create() does,
      then POST it to /api/tx/send. Signing is never done over the network;
      an integrator holds and signs with their own keys, the same as any
      Bitcoin-style wallet integration would.

  One real structural difference from Bitcoin: a LapseCoin node has a
  single wallet address, not per-customer address generation (no
  getnewaddress equivalent). An integrator wanting one deposit address per
  customer needs to run one node per customer, or track customers by a
  memo/tag against a single shared address, the same way exchanges already
  handle XRP- or Monero-style account-index coins.
