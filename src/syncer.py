FETCH_CHUNK = 50    # blocks per GETSYNC request
# peer_udp.py now has real chunk-level ACK/retransmit for multi-chunk UDP
# messages, so a single dropped datagram no longer silently fails an entire
# page -- the old rationale for keeping this very small (5) no longer
# applies. 50 is chosen the way real sync protocols size a batch: well
# below the hard caps (MAX_SYNC_BLOCKS=500 blocks per request, and
# MAX_CHUNK_TOTAL=2000 chunks / ~2.8MB per reassembled message in
# peer_udp.py), not matched to them -- a block would need to average
# ~56KB for 50 of them to approach that reassembly ceiling even under
# heavy real transaction load (FALCON-512 signatures run large, but not
# that large). Fewer round trips than before for a long initial sync,
# with real recovery underneath if a chunk is still lost along the way.

# Extra attempts before treating an outright timeout/decode-failure (resp is
# None) as authoritative. The UDP transport has no chunk-level retransmission
# (see peer_udp.py), so a single dropped datagram during the binary-search
# fork-point probe previously looked identical to "peer's chain doesn't
# reach this height", and one during a fetch page looked identical to "fetch
# failed" -- either way narrowing the search or aborting the sync on nothing
# more than packet loss. This does not apply to a real response with an
# empty/missing chain field, which is a legitimate answer, not a timeout.
