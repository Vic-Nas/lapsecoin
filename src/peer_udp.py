"""UDP peer transport: the single socket that replaces all HTTP peer communication.

One UDP socket per node handles everything:
  - PING/PONG    : reachability check + NAT-observed public IP discovery
  - PEERS        : peer list exchange
  - BLOCK        : block gossip
  - TX           : transaction gossip (Dandelion stem/fluff)
  - GETSYNC      : request chain segment
  - SYNC         : chain segment response (chunked for large syncs)
  - PUNCH_REQ    : ask relay to coordinate a hole punch to a third peer
  - PUNCH_GO     : relay telling us to punch toward a peer right now

Reliability layer
-----------------
Large messages (SYNC, full block) are chunked into MAX_CHUNK_SIZE UDP datagrams.
Each chunk is numbered; for a genuinely multi-chunk message (chunk_total > 1),
the receiver ACKs its current chunk holdings (MT_ACK) after every chunk it
gets, and the sender resends only what's still missing, for up to
CHUNK_ACK_MAX_ROUNDS rounds (see _send_chunked / _retransmit_until_acked /
_handle_ack). A message still stuck incomplete after that, or one whose
reassembly buffer just goes stale from real inactivity, is dropped
(_Reassembler.evict_stale), same as before. Talking to a peer too old to
know MT_ACK exists degrades safely to exactly that prior behavior: no ACK
ever arrives, every round resends the whole message (wasteful but harmless,
chunks are idempotent to re-receive), and it's abandoned once
CHUNK_ACK_MAX_ROUNDS is exhausted rather than hanging. The caller's own
retry cadence (periodic syncer re-poll, gossip re-broadcast) is still the
backstop above this layer, same as always.
Small messages (PING, PEERS, TX, small blocks) fit in one datagram, stay
pure fire-and-forget (no ACK tracking overhead), with application-level
retry handled by the caller.

Wire format
-----------
All datagrams: [1 byte msg_type][2 byte chunk_id][2 byte chunk_total][payload]
If chunk_total == 1 the message is not chunked (fire-and-forget).
Payload is msgpack-encoded for compactness (falls back to json).

Public interface
----------------
  UDPTransport(host, port, genesis_hash, on_block, on_tx, on_peers, pool)
  .start()                    bind socket, start recv loop thread
  .stop()
  .ping(addr)                 fire-and-forget
  .send_block(block, peers, stemming)  put a block on the wire
  .send_tx(tx, peers, stemming)       put a tx on the wire
     Neither relays on the receiver's behalf: what to forward, to whom,
     and whether it is still private is decided in gossip.py after Node
     has validated the item.
  .request_sync(addr, from_h) request chain from peer, returns list|None
  .send_peers(addr, peers)    send peer list to addr
  .punch_via(relay, target)   ask relay to coordinate punch to target
  .broadcast_discover()       announce our data port on the shared
                               LAN_DISCOVERY_PORT; peers with the same
                               genesis on this network segment find and
                               ping us back regardless of their own data
                               port, no DHT/NAT/punching needed
  .our_external_addr          best-known external ip:port (str or None)

Module-level:
  probe_lan_ports(genesis_hash)   standalone, run before choosing a data

                                   LAN are already using, so a second
