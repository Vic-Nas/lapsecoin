"""DHT peer discovery coordinator, UDP edition.

Removes all HTTP probing and UPnP. Candidate pipeline now:
  1. Receive candidate addr from DHT / peer-exchange / --peer CLI
  2. UDP PING the candidate (3s timeout)
  3. PONG confirms reachability AND gives us our external IP
  4. Exchange peer lists via UDP PEERS message
  5. Admit to PeerPool

Separately, a periodic LAN broadcast (UDPTransport.broadcast_discover) finds
nodes on the same local network directly. No DHT round-trip and no
NAT/punching. It announces our own data port on a small fixed
LAN_DISCOVERY_PORT every node also listens on, so two nodes on the same
network that happen to run on different data ports (e.g. two machines
behind the same router, each with its own port-forward) still find each
other; a private-source reply then proves direct reachability on sight
(see peer_udp._is_lan_source). This is what lets two machines behind the
same router/public IP peer automatically instead of needing a manual add.

Hole punching
-------------
When PING times out (node is behind NAT) we attempt a hole punch
via any already-connected peer acting as relay:
  1. Ask relay to forward PUNCH_REQ to target
  2. Both sides fire simultaneous UDP packets
  3. Retry PING after 1s

Our own external address
------------------------
Learned from the first PONG reply (the peer tells us what IP:port
they saw the packet arrive from). This replaces both UPnP and the
ipify.org HTTP call. Also updated every time any PONG arrives.
