  # LapseCoin

  Peer-to-peer electronic cash, secured by a Verifiable Delay Function instead of proof-of-work mining, with quantum-resistant signatures.

**Recommended: use a pre-built release.** Building from source requires native libraries (liboqs, chiavdf) that involve complex C/C++ compilation and can produce DLL or shared library errors depending on your platform. The release binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/Vic-Nas/lapsecoin/releases) are self-contained and require no dependencies.

## Quick start

Grab a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/Vic-Nas/lapsecoin/releases), self-contained with no dependencies.

```
# Linux                    # Windows
chmod +x lapsecoin         lapsecoin.exe
./lapsecoin
```

You'll be prompted for a signing passphrase, then the wallet is at `http://localhost:8335` and the block explorer at `http://localhost:8333`.

<summary>How consensus works</summary>

Most cumulative proven work wins, first valid block received: Bitcoin-style consensus. Block timing is enforced by a VDF anchored to real elapsed time, believed to have a much smaller hardware-advantage gap than proof-of-work. Transactions are ordinary and plaintext, with sender-bid fees, much like Bitcoin's own. Signatures are FALCON-512 (quantum-resistant). Full spec in [docs/whitepaper.md](docs/whitepaper.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Running from source</summary>

Requires Python 3.11+ and native build dependencies for your platform (liboqs, chiavdf).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Building the binary yourself</summary>

```
pip install pyinstaller cairosvg Pillow miniupnpc
make linux    # on Linux
make windows  # on Windows
```

Produces a self-contained binary in `dist/`. Requires cmake, ninja, and a C compiler (on Windows, also liboqs and MSVC redistributables).

<summary>Ports and passphrase</summary>

| | Port | Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public | `8333` (`--port`) | `0.0.0.0` | Node UI + peer API. Safe to expose. Send disabled. |
| Private | `port+2` (`--private-port`) | `127.0.0.1` | Wallet UI. **Never expose.** Full access, including Send. |

`port+3` is reserved for the DHT subsystem (libtorrent). Port `18334` is fixed and reserved across every node for same-network peer discovery (broadcast-based, finds other LapseCoin nodes on your LAN automatically regardless of their own port). Don't bind other services to either.

The passphrase is required to start the node. By default you're prompted via `getpass` (nothing touches shell history or `ps`). For Docker/systemd/CI, set it non-interactively instead:

```bash
export LAPSECOIN_PASSPHRASE="your passphrase"
python main.py
```

There is no `--passphrase` flag, since it was removed because it leaked into `ps aux` and shell history.

<summary>All CLI options</summary>

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Interface to bind for the public port |
| `--port` | `8333` | Public port for HTTP API and peer connections |
| `--private-port` | `port+2` | Private port for wallet UI, always bound to 127.0.0.1 |
| `--keyfile` | `lapsecoin_key.json` | Path to encrypted keypair |
| `--db` | `lapsecoin_chain.db` | Path to SQLite chain database |
| `--peer host:port` | - | Bootstrap peer (repeatable) |
| `--max-peers` | `125` | Hard cap on peer table size |
| `--log-level` | `INFO` | Verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR |
</details>
